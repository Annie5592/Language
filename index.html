    <h2>Language</h2>
    <p>A language is a structured system of communication used by humans, based on speech and gesture 
    (spoken language), sign, or often writing. The structure of language is its grammar and the free
    components are its vocabulary. Many languages, including the most widely-spoken ones, have writing
    systems that enable sounds or signs to be recorded for later reactivation.
